# Challenge 4: SaaS Subscription Management Page

## Description

Design a subscription management page for a SaaS application that allows users to view, manage, and upgrade their subscriptions. The page should provide a clear overview of the user's current subscription status.

### Requirements

- The subscription management page should include:
  - **Current Subscription Plan**: Display details of the user’s current plan, including pricing and features.
  - **Billing Information**: Show billing history and upcoming payments.
  - **Upgrade/Downgrade Options**: Allow users to easily change their subscription plan.
  - **Cancellation Option**: Provide a clear process for canceling the subscription.

## Validation

- Ensure that all information is accurate and updated in real-time.
- Use clear labels and calls-to-action for subscription management options.
- Ensure that the layout is intuitive and easy to navigate.

## User Feedback

- Provide confirmation messages when users make changes to their subscriptions (e.g., upgrade, downgrade, cancel).
- Implement error handling for any issues during the subscription management process.

## Recommended Technologies

- **Figma**: For designing the layout and user interface.
- **React**: For building interactive components on the page.
- **Stripe API** (or similar): For integrating payment processing and managing subscriptions.

## Challenge Objective

The objective of this challenge is to assess the candidate’s ability to create a clear and user-friendly interface for managing subscriptions in a SaaS application.

## Tips

- Focus on providing a seamless user experience by minimizing the number of steps required for actions.
- Use clear and concise language throughout the page.
- Ensure that important information is highlighted and easy to find.

## Final Considerations

This challenge should take approximately 1 hour to complete. Candidates should emphasize clarity and ease of use while designing the page. If time runs out, the focus is on design thinking rather than completion.

## Submission Instructions

- Submit designs as a link to a prototype or downloadable files (e.g., Figma links).
- Include a brief explanation of design choices and any challenges faced.
