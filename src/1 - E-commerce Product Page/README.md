# Challenge 1: E-commerce Product Page

## Description

Create a responsive product page for an e-commerce website. The page should display product images, details, pricing, and an "Add to Cart" button. The design must be visually appealing and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.

### Requirements

- The product page should include the following elements:
  - **Product Images**: Multiple images of the product, including a zoom feature on hover to allow users to view details.
  - **Product Title**: A clear and concise title that represents the product.
  - **Product Description**: A detailed description highlighting key features and specifications.
  - **Price**: Display the price prominently, including any discounts or special offers.
  - **"Add to Cart" Button**: A clear call-to-action button that adds the product to the shopping cart.
  - **Quantity Selector**: An input field to allow users to select the desired quantity before adding to the cart.
  - **User Reviews and Ratings Section**: A section displaying user reviews, ratings, and comments about the product.

## Validation

- Ensure that the page is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- The "Add to Cart" button should only be active if a valid quantity is selected (greater than zero).
- Include appropriate error messages if users attempt to add an invalid quantity to the cart (e.g., negative numbers or zero).
- Provide visual feedback when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked (e.g., change color or show a loading spinner).

## User Feedback

- Use animations or transitions to enhance the user experience when adding an item to the cart.
- Show a success message when an item is successfully added to the cart (e.g., "Item added to cart!").
- Consider displaying a modal or notification to confirm the addition of the item to the cart.

## Recommended Technologies

- **Figma**: For wireframing and designing the layout, ensuring that the user interface is visually appealing.
- **React**: For building the interactive components of the product page, allowing for dynamic content and user interactions.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: For styling the page and ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
- **Redux** (optional): For state management, especially if the application grows in complexity.

## Challenge Objective

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate the candidateâ€™s ability to design and implement a product page that is not only visually appealing but also functional, providing a great user experience. Candidates should demonstrate their understanding of user-centered design principles and their ability to create an intuitive interface.

## Tips

- Focus on creating a clean layout that highlights the product's key information.
- Use high-quality images to enhance visual appeal; consider using a lightbox effect for product images.
- Utilize whitespace effectively to improve readability and draw attention to important elements.
- Incorporate accessibility best practices, such as using alt text for images and ensuring proper contrast ratios for text and background colors.
- Pay attention to the flow of information, guiding users naturally from product information to the call-to-action.

## Final Considerations

This challenge should take approximately 1 hour to complete. Candidates should feel free to express their creativity while ensuring that all required elements are included. If time runs out and the candidate cannot finish, they should not worry; the goal is to assess their skills rather than their ability to complete the task under pressure. Feedback on their design process and decisions will also be valued.

## Submission Instructions

- Candidates should submit their designs as a link to a live demo (if applicable) or as downloadable files (e.g., Figma links, images).
- Code for the implementation (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) should be pushed to the repository provided by the company.
- Include a brief explanation of the design choices and any challenges faced during implementation.
