# Challenge 2: Mobile App Onboarding Flow

## Description

Design a user-friendly onboarding flow for a mobile application. The onboarding should introduce users to the app's key features, guide them through the setup process, and encourage them to engage with the app.

### Requirements

- The onboarding flow should consist of at least 3 screens:
  - **Welcome Screen**: Briefly introduce the app and its benefits.
  - **Feature Highlights**: Showcase key features with brief descriptions.
  - **Setup Instructions**: Provide users with instructions for setting up their profiles or accounts.
- Include a progress indicator to show users how far they are in the onboarding process.
- Allow users to skip the onboarding process if they prefer.

## Validation

- Ensure that the onboarding screens are visually appealing and aligned with the app's branding.
- The text should be clear, concise, and free of jargon.
- Users should have the option to navigate back and forth between onboarding screens.

## User Feedback

- Provide visual feedback when users complete each step (e.g., animations, checkmarks).
- If users skip onboarding, show a confirmation message stating that they can revisit the onboarding process later.

## Recommended Technologies

- **Figma**: For designing the onboarding flow and creating high-fidelity prototypes.
- **Adobe XD**: For prototyping and user testing of the onboarding experience.
- **React Native**: For building the mobile app interface, ensuring it is responsive across devices.

## Challenge Objective

The objective of this challenge is to assess the candidateâ€™s ability to design an engaging and intuitive onboarding experience that effectively communicates the app's value to new users.

## Tips

- Keep the onboarding process as short and engaging as possible to minimize user drop-off.
- Use engaging visuals and animations to maintain user interest.
- Test the onboarding flow with users to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## Final Considerations

This challenge should take approximately 1 hour to complete. Candidates should focus on clarity and user engagement throughout the onboarding process. If time runs out, the goal is to evaluate design thinking and problem-solving skills rather than completion under pressure.

## Submission Instructions

- Submit designs as a link to a prototype or downloadable files (e.g., Figma links).
- Include a brief explanation of design choices and any challenges faced.
